12-3. I opened Minecraft to put strain on my system, as well as speedtest.net and youtube. I noticed no variation in the velocity numbers before and during the tests. I did, however, notice if the player immediately falls off the platform, the velocity is around 460-500, but when jumping up a platform and then falling off, it shows 300-360, so a pretty significant dip.

Problem #3 - After changing from 9.8m/s/s to 3.0m/s/s, I noticed the value of velocityY changed from around 500 down to around 220.
